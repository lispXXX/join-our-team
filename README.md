## THE 62 YEARS JOURNEY OF LISP
![Lisp_Journey_62_years](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120730594-7d638e80-c4ea-11eb-860a-b7654224acc2.gif)
## How to join the journey?
### *If you're just cruising around Github, that means you're aware of programming languages!*
### **Duh!**
### *But what are you doing not joining the team of the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today?*

### *Well, you should be interested!*
### *We are looking for Lisp programmers who can contribute to the project and do some kick-ass legendary work with us, cause we're looking to gather all Lisp programmers in one place that can do awesome stuff together.*

## *here at LispXXX we're focusing on these dialects:*

![Lisp_LFE_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120835434-ff949700-c56c-11eb-8025-4e25da43a49e.png) 
### LFE:  Initial work on LFE began in 2007 when Robert Virding started creating a prototype of Lisp running on Erlang. This work was focused primarily on parsing and exploring what an implementation might look like. No version control system was being used at the time, so tracking exact initial dates is somewhat problematic.

### Scheme: was created during the 1970s at the MIT AI Lab and released by its developers, Guy L. Steele and Gerald Jay Sussman, via a series of memos now known as the Lambda Papers. It was the first dialect of Lisp to choose Lexical Scope and the first to require implementations to perform tail-call optimization.

### ![Lisp_PicoLisp_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120836741-9150d400-c56e-11eb-954f-04def6bed7e5.png)
### PicoLisp: runs on operating systems including Linux and others that are Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compliant. Its most prominent features are simplicity and minimalism. It is built on one internal data_type: a cell.
##
### ![Lisp_Emacs_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120836812-a7f72b00-c56e-11eb-8c30-f841886e9bf7.png)
### Emacs Lisp: It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C, as is the Lisp interpreter. Emacs Lisp is also termed Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.
##
### ![Lisp_Hy_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120836914-c9581700-c56e-11eb-85ac-5c6e071e6415.png)
### Hy: designed to interact with Python by translating s-expressions into Python's abstract syntax tree (AST). Hy was introduced at Python Conference (PyCon) 2013 by Paul Tagliamonte. Lisp allows operating on code as data (metaprogramming), thus Hy can be used to write domain-specific languages.

### ![Lisp_Racket_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120836954-d7a63300-c56e-11eb-9d27-5c9f3be52407.png)
### Racket: It is designed as a platform for programming language design and implementation. In addition to the core Racket language, Racket is also used to refer to the family of programming languages and set of tools supporting development on and with Racket. Racket is also used for scripting, computer science education, and research.
##
### ![Lisp_Clojure_mini](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81928799/120837022-e7257c00-c56e-11eb-9a98-90416ccc0685.png)
### Clojure: treats code as data and has a Lisp macro system. The current development process is community-driven, overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).

### Common Lisp: developed as a standardized and improved successor of Maclisp, Common Lisp is not an implementation, but rather a language specification. Several implementations of the Common Lisp standard are available, including free and open-source software and proprietary products. Common Lisp is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language.
